Overview
Everyone&#039;s favorite lethal SecUnit is back in the next installment in Martha Wells&#039;s New York Times bestselling Murderbot Diaries series.
 
 Am I making it worse? I think I&#039;m making it worse.
 
 Following the events in Network Effect, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly-colonized planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if thereâ€™s an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza canâ€™t have the planet, theyâ€™re sure as hell not leaving without something. If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free workforce is a decent runner-up prize.
 
 But thereâ€™s something wrong with Murderbot; it isnâ€™t running within normal operational parameters. ARTâ€™s crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect the colonists, but with Barish-Estranzaâ€™s SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams, theyâ€™re going to have to hope Murderbot figures out whatâ€™s wrong with itself, and fast!
 
 Yeah, this plan is... not going to work.
