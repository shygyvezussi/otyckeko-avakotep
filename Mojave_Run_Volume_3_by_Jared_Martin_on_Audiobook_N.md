Overview
THE EPIC BATTLE FOR LIFE CONCLUDES. Now that Croix has found the cure to save his unborn child, he&#039;s faced with another devastating twist of fate: the baby will suffocate the moment she&#039;s born, and if he doesn&#039;t make it back to her in time, the very first breath she takes will be her last. As Brixton loses faith in his beloved corporation, he sets his sights on something far more tangible than their good graces. He wants the Moon Runner, and he wants the crafty outlaw behind the wheel. This sets Brixton and Croix on a collision course that will only end one way: violently. Meanwhile - as Croix&#039;s fellow Revivalists are fighting off a gang of murderous Reapers back home - Zee is struggling to keep the baby inside of her, where her womb is providing the only source of oxygen. Now Croix&#039;s journey to save their unborn child becomes a race against time, nature&#039;s fury, and an evil cult led by the monstrous Pure Blood known as Komanchee. As Croix and Brixton fall deeper into the ever-darkening mystery, they begin to question everything: their past, their purpose, the power behind the Nimbus throne, and even the legendary heroics of Billy Dagger himself. Once all the dark secrets come to light, and the bitter truth is revealed, their conflicting paths of redemption and glory finally collide, as if they were somehow fated to, like flipsides of the same lucky coin. Now some unlucky god will have to call heads or tails. Will Croix save his unborn child before she takes her fatal first breath? Will Brixton catch the outlaw and finally reclaim his &quot;golden boy&quot; legacy? Or will the sins of the past finally catch up to both of them? The epic conclusion to Mojave Run is a heart-stopping thrill ride of betrayal, fatherly sins, deadly secrets and fleeting redemption, with unpredictable twists of fate that will leave you gasping for air. Don&#039;t forget to breathe.
