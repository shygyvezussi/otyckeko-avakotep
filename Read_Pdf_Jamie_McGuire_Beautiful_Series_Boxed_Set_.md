Overview
From New York Times bestselling author Jamie McGuire, a boxed set of the first three books in the “deliciously intense” (USA TODAY) Beautiful series, including Beautiful Disaster—the inspiration behind the major motion picture—Walking Disaster, and A Beautiful Wedding.

 In the “insanely addictive” (Jessica Park, New York Times bestselling author) Beautiful Disaster, Abby Abernathy is determined to leave her dark past behind as she begins college. But when she meets the campus charmer, Travis Maddox, all her plans disappear. Travis is intrigued by the standoffish Abby and devises a plot to pull her into his life, unaware that he has met his match.

 Then in Walking Disaster, Travis thinks he is far too strong to fall for a woman. But Abby has changed his life completely in this retelling of Beautiful Disaster from his perspective.

 Finally, Abby and Travis have unexpectedly married. Everything about their elopement has been top-secret...until now in the whirlwind romance A Beautiful Wedding.
