 Addison
 I never thought I would see him again.
 Especially while I was planning someone else&#039;s weddingâ€”yet there he was holding hands with his girlfriend.
 Our one night was wild and passionate; I could never forget him because it changed my life.
 Now he&#039;s hereâ€”and the result of our one night is twirling in a princess dress at our feet.

 Stefano
 I didn&#039;t make mistakes.
 I was the one you called in when you needed answers.
 I was cutthroat but they didn&#039;t pay me to be nice.
 I was in control every single second.
 The only time I let my guard down was five years ago.
 If I thought seeing the woman I could never forget again would throw me offâ€”it&#039;s nothing like seeing our daughter for the first time.
