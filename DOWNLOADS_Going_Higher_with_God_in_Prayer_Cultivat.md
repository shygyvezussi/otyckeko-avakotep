Overview
What&#039;s Keeping Your Prayers from Being Effective?

 Learning how to pray is one of the greatest challenges in a Christian&#039;s life. A.W. Tozer pointed out that the Church&#039;s greatest curse is unanswered prayer, and that many people do not seem bothered by that. Maybe they don&#039;t understand what answered prayer is all about. Tozer outlines this as only he can, describing the kind of prayer God answers and the kind of prayer that leaves Him silent. Ultimately, you have to ask yourself: are my prayers today more powerful and effective than they were a year ago? Our good Father wants them to be!

 The book opens with Jacob&#039;s Ladder and its theme of ascending into God&#039;s very presence. What better place to begin dialoging with God? Only He can teach us what is on His heart, what His will is, and what our part in it could be.
