Faced with the choice of being married to a strange spirit or being made into dinner, Aoi decides to create a third option for herself!

 Aoi Tsubaki inherited her grandfather’s ability to see spirits—and his massive debt to them! Now she’s been kidnapped and taken to Kakuriyo, the spirit world, to make good on his bill. Her options: marry the head of the inn her grandfather trashed, or get eaten by demons. But Aoi isn’t the type to let spirits push her around, and she’s determined to redeem her grandfather’s IOU on her own terms!

 After the chaos of being kidnapped and falling ill, Aoi is enjoying the chance to relax and create new recipes for Yūgao’s menu. As usual, the ayakashi of Tenjin-ya love everything she makes and their enthusiasm is invigorating. But nothing is simple in Kakuriyo, and even a day off comes with strange encounters and odd new information.
